The automatic parking gate was designed so that when a car is detected and there is an available parking space, the barrier opens. The program that controls the barrier was created to illustrate this process. In this regard, the parking lot is considered full after three cars have entered, after which the barrier will no longer open. To determine if there is an available parking space, an LCD was used to show a representative message, along with a green and a red LED.
